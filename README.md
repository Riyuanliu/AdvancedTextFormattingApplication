Advanced Text Formatting Application

# Advanced Text Formatting Application

The Advanced Text Formatting Application is a C++ project designed to provide powerful text formatting capabilities. The application allows users to input text and apply various formatting options, including limiting the amount of text per line, specifying titles, and managing text alignment (left, right, or center).

## Key Features

### Text Input
Users can input text into the application through a user-friendly interface. The text can be copied and pasted from external sources or typed directly into the application.

### Line Length Limit
The application allows users to set a maximum character limit for each line of text. When the user's input exceeds this limit, the application will automatically wrap the text to the next line while preserving words and maintaining readability.

### Title Formatting
Users can specify certain lines of text as titles. Titles can be used to introduce sections or highlight important information. The application provides a dedicated option to format text as a title, which adjusts the font size, weight, and possibly color to make the title stand out.

### Alignment Options
The application offers three alignment options: left, right, and center. Users can select the alignment for individual lines or groups of lines. This feature is particularly useful for creating visually appealing text layouts, such as centered headings or right-aligned source code excerpts.

### Error Handling
The application includes robust error handling to ensure that user input is validated and processed correctly. If the user enters invalid values or text that cannot be formatted properly, the application provides informative error messages.

### Export and Sharing
Once the user is satisfied with the formatting, they can export the formatted text as a plain text file, a rich text format (RTF) file, or even copy it to the clipboard for easy sharing with other applications.

### Customization
The application allows users to customize certain formatting settings, such as font styles, colors, and alignment defaults, to match their preferences.

This C++ project involves implementing text parsing, formatting logic, user interface design, and error handling. Libraries like the Standard Template Library (STL) can be used for efficient text manipulation, and additional libraries for graphical user interface (GUI) development can be integrated for a polished user experience.

Through this Advanced Text Formatting Application, users will have a powerful tool at their disposal for creating neatly formatted documents, code snippets, or any type of text content that requires careful arrangement and presentation.
